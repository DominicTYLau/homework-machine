# Homework Machine

The Homework Machine is a 2D plotter that automates solving and writing homework with a personalized touch. Users can upload homework images via a frontend interface, captured using their phone and connected through DroidCam and OBS for a virtual camera feed. Its standout feature is handwriting synthesis, which mimics handwriting styles, including a primed synthesis option for users to upload their own handwriting for an authentic, customized result.
